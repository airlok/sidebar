# Sidebar

**Demo:** http://sidebar-demo.herokuapp.com/

A free and open-source sidebar for use in your projects. The CSS depends on Bootstrap.

This was tested with Bootstrap v2.1.1, which I have included for convenience. The design of the sidebar is courtesy of [Premium Pixels](http://premiumpixels.com).
